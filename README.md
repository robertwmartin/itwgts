## A Thought Experiment
This repo should not be viewed as nihilistic or fatalistic. Rather, it is an extension of the absolute wonder and awe resulting from the complex technological underpinnings of our modern world. Yes, some days it seems implausible that our society could actually make skyscrpaers that do not fall over, or international flights that do not crash, but, for the most part, that is the reality of our lives. The analogy holds for the Internet and Internet technologies - somehow this complicated and complex array of servers, apps, APIs, scripts, hardware, networks, and probably in more than one case, duct tape, provides our world with the foundation for modern technologies and computing. 

That said, the state of the world seems to be getting worse, and so a thought experiment was in order: How would the engineers and technicians that make their living on Internet technologies contribute in a world that went to shit? What would they need to maintain, repair, and potentially reboot the world? 


## What is ITWGTS?
We are creating a repository of technical information needed to preserve the aspects of our society that rely on computer networking and Internet technologies. This repository is called ITWGTS, which is pronounced "it wiggets" and stands for "If the world goes to shit".

The potential reasons for requiring this repository are many - nuclear war, societal collapse, runaway climate change, fracturing of nation states, the end of an open Internet, etc. The desire is to ensure that we could keep as much of the world we have today running through a large-scale, global change up until the point in time where society is rebuilt. 

The target audience is the engineers, technicians, IT professionals, tinkers, and hobbyists that currently know how to make technologies work. Think **hacker** as it was originally defined.


## Scope and Time Frame
While an all-encompassing repository that embraces multiple cultures and languages would be great, the contents of this repository will be English only for now. 

A world that needs ITWGTS will not be static and will not persist beyond a decade or two. If civilization rebuilds, newer tech will be introduced and the need for ITWGTS as an essential resource will diminish. If society does not rebuild, the technology base will eventually stop working, rendering ITWGTS moot. 

Extending this thinking, it becomes clear that ITWGTS is best understood as a **preservation mechanism**, one that focuses on maintaining the systems that everyone relies on today until society can rebuild. This means ITWGTS does not need to be a resource for obsolete or outmoded technologies like Morse code, Banyan Vines, or creating or repairing vacuum tubes. 


## Out of Scope
ITWGTS is not:
- a comprehensive disaster preparation manual for all aspects of life.
- about survival techniques like farming, foraging, hunting, etc.
- about any political or social model.
- a repository of all of the world's historical, cultural, or research material.

## The Layers of ITWGTS

To keep ITWGTS from becoming the Everything Repo, ITWGTS is split into three layers - Core, Adjacent, and Bridges. 

- **ITWGTS Core**: Operating systems, networking, programming, crypto, reference docs.
- **ITWGTS Adjacent**: Communications beyond the Internet, electronics, power, data preservation, standards.
- **ITWGTS Bridges**: Interfaces with monitoring systems, logistics, information stewardship and keeping the systems working that enable these domains.

Each layer has its own directory structure. Scope and definition information is included in each directory.
